 * Add CMake based names such as PROJECT_NAME in between @ signs. Then when we configure the project, those names get taken from 
 * CMakeLists.txt file and a new file called fileName.hpp gets created in build folder which can be used in the project. this file
 * has updated values for this @ signs based values.
